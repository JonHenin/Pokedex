# POKEMON DETECTION USING YOLO [![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)](LICENSE)

### Project Description
In the world of Pokemon, a Pokedex is a tool that can detect and recognize Pokemon.  This project is inspired by that.  Using the YOLOv3 computer vision algorithm, a model was built to detect some Pokemon.

## Data

The images come from two sources.  The first and largest source is from the Kaggle Project "Pokemon Generation One", found here:
https://www.kaggle.com/thedagger/pokemon-generation-one/data#

The other is from a Google image search.

Images were manually tagged using Microsoft's [VoTT](https://github.com/microsoft/VoTT)
